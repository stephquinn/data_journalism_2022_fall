## Chapter 29

Up to now, we've been looking at patterns in data for what is more than this, or what's the middle look like. We've calculated metrics like per capita rates, or looked at how data changes over time.

Another way we can look at the data is geographically. Is there a spatial pattern to our data? Can we learn anything by using distance as a metric? What if we merge non-geographic data into geographic data?

The bad news is that there isn't a One Library To Rule Them All when it comes to geo queries in R. But there's one emerging, called Simple Features, that is very good.

Go to the console and install it with `install.packages("sf")`

To understand geographic queries, you have to get a few things in your head first:

1. Your query is using planar space. Usually that's some kind of projection of the world. If you're lucky, your data is projected, and the software will handle projection differences under the hood without you knowing anything about it.
2. Projections are cartographers making opinionated decisions about what the world should look like when you take a spheroid -- the earth isn't perfectly round -- and flatten it. Believe it or not, every state in the US has their own geographic projection. There's dozens upon dozens of them.
3. Geographic queries work in layers. In most geographic applications, you'll have multiple layers. You'll have a boundary file, and a river file, and a road file, and a flood file and combined together they make the map. But you have to think in layers.
4. See 1. With layers, they're all joined together by the planar space. So you don't need to join one to the other like we did earlier -- the space has done that. So you can query how many X are within the boundaries on layer Y. And it's the plane that holds them together.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/geolayers.jpg")
```

## Importing and viewing data

Let's start with the absolute basics of geographic data: loading and viewing. Load libraries as usual.

### Task 1: Load packages
**Task** Run the following code to load packages.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(janitor)
```

First: an aside on geographic data. There are many formats for geographic data, but data type you'll see the most is called the shapefile. It comes from a company named ERSI, which created the most widely used GIS software in the world. For years, they were the only game in town, really, and the shapefile became ubiquitous, especially so in government and utilities.

So more often than not, you'll be dealing with a shapefile. But a shapefile isn't just a single file -- it's a collection of files that combined make up all the data that allow you to use it. There's a .shp file -- that's the main file that pulls it all together -- but it's important to note if your shapefiles has a .prj file, which indicates that the projection is specified.

You also might be working with a GeoDatabase, or a .gdb file. That's a slightly different, more compact version of a Shapefile.

The data we're going to be working with is a GeoDatabase from the [Prince George's County Department of Planning](https://gisdata.pgplanning.org/opendata/) that contains information about the county's election precincts.

### Task: Load the Prince George's County election precinct data.

Simlar to `readr`, the `sf` library has functions to read geographic data. In this case, we're going to use `st_read` to read in our precinct data. And then glimpse it to look at the columns.

### Task: Load data
**Task** Run the following code to load data. Describe what you see in the answer space below. What columns exist in this data?
**Answer** What I see looks much like what I would expect to see if I glimpsed a csv file. The columns include precinct ID, precinct name (poll locations), and a series of district numbers (school districts and Congressional districts) for each precinct. The "shape" column contains a new data type - multipolygon, which contains multiple latitudes and longitudes and enables R to draw the shapes of precincts.

```{r}
pg_precincts <- st_read("data/Election_Precinct_2022_Py.gdb")

glimpse(pg_precincts)
```

This looks like a normal dataframe, and mostly it is.  We have one row per precinct, and each column is some feature of that precinct: the ID, name and more.  What sets this data apart from other dataframes we've used is the last column, "Shape", which is of a new data type. It's not a character or a number, it's a "Multipolygon", which is composed of multiple longitude and latitude values. When we plot these on a grid of latitude and longitude, it will draw those shapes on a map.

Let's look at these precincts. We have 356 of them, according to this data.

### Task: Run code
**Task** Run the following code. Describe the output in the space below: what kind of information does it contain?
**Answer** The dataframe includes precinct ids and names, Congressional, legislative, council and school districts for each precinct, and geographical data, including the multipolygon column with information enabling R to draw precinct shapes on a plane.

```{r}
View(pg_precincts)
```

But where in Prince George's County are these places? We can simply plot them on a longitude-latitude grid using ggplot and geom_sf.

### Task: Run code
**Task** Run the following code. Describe the output in the space below.
**Answer** I see a map of Prince George's county on a grid showing longitude and latitude, as well as the outline of the 356 precincts in the county. Ghost precincts are white, while the precincts where voters live are shaded gray.

```{r}
pg_precincts %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf() +
  theme_minimal()
```

Each shape is a precinct, with the boundaries plotted according to its degrees of longitude and latitude.

If you know anything about Prince George's, you can kinda pick out the geographic context here. To the west is the District of Columbia, for example. College Park is near the top. But this map is not exactly ideal. It would help to have a state and county map layered underneath of it, to help make sense of the spatial nature of this data.

This is where layering becomes more clear. First, we want to go out and get another shapefile, this one showing Maryland county outlines.

Instead of loading it from our local machine, like we did above, we're going to use a package to directly download it from the U.S. Census.  The package is called `tigris` and it's developed by the same person who made `tidycensus`.

In the console, install tigris with `install.packages('tigris')`

Then load it:

### Task: Run code
**Task** Run the following code. Describe the output in the space below.
**Answer** I don't see anything yet - just that the library has been installed. Hope I'm not missing something here....

```{r}
# install.packages('tigris')
library(tigris)
```

Now, let's use the counties() function from tigris to pull down a shapefile of all U.S. counties.

### Task: Run code
**Task** Run the following code. Describe the output in the space below.
**Answer** I see a dataframe showing 18 columns of 2020 data for all 3,234 counties in the U.S., including county and state identifying numbers. As in the dataframe for Prince George's County precincts from the county planning department, the last column contains multipolygon data, this time named "geometry" instead of "Shape."
```{r}

counties <- counties()

glimpse(counties)
```

This looks pretty similar to our places shapefile, in that it looked mostly like a normal dataframe with the exception of the new geometry column (this time called `geometry`, which is pretty common).

This county shapefile has all 3233 U.S. counties.  We only want the Maryland counties, so we're going to filter the data to only keep Maryland counties.  There is no STATE column, but there is a STATEFP column, with each number representing a state.  Maryland's FP number is 24.

### Task: Run code
**Task** Run the following code. Describe the output in the space below.
**Answer**
After filtering for Maryland counties only, the dataframe shows the same columns as before, but only for Maryland's 23 counties and Baltimore City.
```{r}
md_counties <- counties %>%
  filter(STATEFP == "24")

```

To see what this looks like, let's plot it out with ggplot. We can pretty clearly see the shapes of Maryland counties.

### Task: Run code
**Task** Run the following code. Describe the output in the space below.
**Answer** I see a county map of Maryland (which also includes Baltimore City) with latitude and longitude lines. It shows how the Chesapeake Bay is carved up into county jurisdictions.

```{r}
md_counties %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf() +
  theme_minimal()
```

With this county map, we can layer our places data. We'll narrow it down to just Prince George's County to get an outline.

Something to note: The layers are rendered in the order they appear. So the first geom_sf is rendered first. The second geom_sf is rendered ON TOP OF the first one.

We're also going to change things up a bit to put the datasets we want to display INSIDE of the geom_sf() function, instead of starting with a dataframe.  We have two to plot now, so it's easier this way.

### Task: Run code
**Task** Run the following code. Describe the output in the space below.
**Answer** I see a map of Prince George's County precincts from the county planning site layered on top of the map of Prince George's County from the U.S. census, since we filtered for Prince George's County's county code. The maps are still on a grid with latitude and longitude lines. Since we're looking at layered maps now, there's a visible discrepancy between the boundaries of the southeastern precincts from the two sources.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=md_counties %>% filter(COUNTYFP == "033")) +
  geom_sf(data=pg_precincts) +
  theme_minimal()
```
Notice the subtle differences at the boundaries?

Let's dive back into Prince George's precincts and see what more we can find out about them. It would be useful to know, for example, what turnout was like for the July primary election. We can use [the state's data](https://elections.maryland.gov/press_room/2022_stats/Official%20by%20Party%20and%20Precinct.csv) to determine this. 

### Task: Run code to load the turnout data from the July 2022 Primary election
**Task** Run the following code. Describe the output in the space below.
**Answer** I see a dataframe showing how many voters in each of Prince George's precincts cast early votes, absentee ballots and provisional votes in the July primary, as well as those precincts' total turnout and total eligible voters.

```{r}
primary_22 <- read_csv("data/Official by Party and Precinct.csv") %>% clean_names()
pg_turnout <- primary_22 %>% 
  filter(lbe == "Prince George's") %>% 
  group_by(precinct) %>% 
  summarise(total_polls = sum(polls), total_early = sum(early_voing), total_absentee = sum(absentee), total_provisional = sum(provisional), total_eligible = sum(eligible_voters))

View(pg_turnout)
```
Now we can join the precincts to the turnout data.

### Task: Run code to join the precinct shapes with the voter turnout data
**Task** Run the following code. Describe the output in the space below.
**Answer** For each precinct, I can now see turnout data (total turnout, total eligible voters and breakdown of absentee, early and provisional ballots) as well as the districts these precincts are in and the multipolygon information from the pg_precincts dataframe.

```{r}
pg_precincts_with_turnout <- pg_precincts %>% left_join(pg_turnout, by=c("PRECINCT_ID"="precinct"))
```

Now we can use color to distinguish precincts from each other. Let's use the total eligible voters to start with:

### Task: Run code
**Task** Run the following code. Describe the output in the space below.
**Answer** I now see the number of eligible voters in each Prince George's precinct color-coded on the map, which makes it a lot easier to compare numbers of eligible voters in different precincts. The center of the county seems to have the highest concentration of eligible voters. I can also see several ghost precincts, where no voters live, with no blue fill.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=pg_precincts_with_turnout, aes(fill=total_eligible)) +
  scale_colour_viridis_b(option="magma") +
  theme_minimal()
```

With these changes, what else can we make out here? First, you can pretty easily spot our "ghost precincts" - they are the ones in white, where there are no eligible voters. But you also can see that there's some pretty big variation among the number of eligible voters per precinct across the county, with some very large ones in the middle.

## Chapter 21

In the previous chapter, we looked at election precincts in Prince George's County to show a bit of a pattern regarding concentration of the precincts with the most and 0 eligible voters. Let's go little further and look at voters statewide.

First, let's load the libraries we'll need. We're also going to load tidycensus and set an API key for tidycensus.

### Task: Load libraries
**Task** Run the following code. Describe the output in the space below. Be sure to input your census api key.
**Answer** I just see that the libraries have been loaded.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(janitor)
library(tidycensus)
#census_api_key("549950d36c22ff16455fe196bbbd01d63cfbe6cf")
```

For the rest of this chapter, we're going to work on building a map that will help us gain insight into geographic patterns in voter registration by county in Maryland. Our question: by examining the number of Democrats/Republicans/Unaffiliated voters per 100,000 people in each county, what regional geographic patterns can we identify?

We've got voters by county, so let's load that from the data folder and take a look:

### Task: Run code
**Task** Run the following code. Describe the output in the space below.
**Answer** I see a dataframe showing numbers of registered voters by party, including "other" and "unaffiliated," as well as total numbers of registered voters, for each county in Maryland (and Baltimore City).

```{r}
voters_by_county <- read_csv("data/eligible_voters.csv")

voters_by_county %>% arrange(desc(TOTAL))
```
So, what do we see here? Montgomery County has the most, followed by Prince George's & Baltimore County. Checks out.

Next, we'll go out and get population data for each county from tidycensus. The variable for total population is B01001_001.  

### Task: Run code
**Task** Run the following code. Describe the output in the space below.
**Answer** The dataframe shows population and geoid for each Maryland county (and Baltimore City) from census data. Unlike in the voters_by_county dataframe, the county names include " County, Maryland."

```{r}
md_county_population <- get_acs(geography = "county",
              variables = c(population = "B01001_001"),
              state = "MD")

md_county_population 
```

Ultimately, we're going to join this county population table with our voters by county table, and then calculate a voters per 50,000 people statistic.  But remember, we then want to visualize this data by drawing a county map that helps us pick out trends. Thinking ahead, we know we'll need a county map shapefile.  Fortunately, we can pull this geometry information right from tidycensus at the same time that we pull in the population data by adding "geometry = TRUE" to our get_acs function.

### Task: Run code
**Task** Run the following code. Describe the output in the space below.
**Answer** I see a dataframe showing census population estimates per county, as in the previous dataframe, but this time there is also a geometry column with multipolygon information that will allow us to draw a county map.

```{r}
md_county_population <- get_acs(geography = "county",
              variables = c(population = "B01001_001"),
              state = "MD",
              geometry = TRUE)

md_county_population
```
We now have a new column, geometry, that contains the "MULTIPOLYGON" data that will draw an outline of each county when we go to draw a map.

The next step will be to join our population data to our voter data on the county column.

But there's a problem.  The column in our population data that has county names is called "NAME", and it has the full name of the county spelled out in title case -- first word capitalized and has "County" and "Maryland" in it.  The voter data just has the name of the county.  For example, the population data has "Anne Arundel County, Maryland" and the voter data has "Anne Arundel".

### Task: Run code
**Task** Run the following code. Describe the output in the space below.
**Answer** For voters_by_county, I see the numbers of voters in each county by party, as well as the total number of voters per county. 

```{r}
md_county_population

voters_by_county
```

If they're going to join properly, we need to clean one of them up to make it match the other.  

Let's clean the population table. We're going to rename the "NAME" column to "County", then remove ", Maryland" and "County" and make the county titlecase. Next we'll remove any white spaces after that first cleaning step that, if left in, would prevent a proper join. We're also going to rename the column that contains the population information from "estimate" to "population" and select only the county name and the population columns, along with the geometry. That leaves us with this tidy table.

### Task: Run code
**Task** Run the following code. Describe the output in the space below.
**Answer**
Now md_county_population has only three columns: "County," renamed from "NAME," with cleaned county names, "population," renamed from "estimate," and the geometry column with multipolygon data. Now we can join md_county_population and voters_by_county on the "County" columns.
```{r}
md_county_population <- md_county_population %>%
  rename(County = NAME) %>%
  mutate(County = str_to_title(str_remove_all(County,", Maryland|County"))) %>%
  mutate(County = str_trim(County,side="both")) %>%
  rename(population = estimate) %>%
  select(County, population, geometry)

md_county_population
```
Now we can join them.  

### Task: Run code
**Task** Run the following code. Describe the output in the space below.
**Answer** Now the cleaned md_county_population database described above is joined to the numbers showing party membership, total registered voters and multipolygon information for each county from the voters_by_county dataframe.

The joined dataframe preserved the names for St. Mary's and Baltimore County from the md_county_population dataframe, since it was the first in the join. Because these names didn't match their corresponding names in the voters_by_county dataframe, the dataframe shows "NA" for these rows.
```{r}
md_voters_per_10k <- md_county_population %>%
  left_join(voters_by_county)

md_voters_per_10k
```
Hang on - there's at least one county with NA values - St. Mary's, which is spelled "Saint Mary's" in the voter dataframe. And Baltimore County didn't match, either. Let's fix that using if_else, which allows us to conditionally mutate:

### Task: Run code
**Task** Run the following code. Describe the output in the space below.
**Answer**
Now the all the county names in md_county_population dataframe match those in the voters_by_county dataframe so we can successfully join the dataframes.
```{r}
md_county_population <- md_county_population %>%
  mutate(County = if_else(County == "St. Mary's", "Saint Mary's", County)) %>% 
  mutate(County = if_else(County == "Baltimore", "Baltimore County", County))

md_county_population
```

Our final step before visualization, let's calculate the number of voters per 10,000 population for each county and sort from highest to lowest to see what trends we can identify just from the table.

### Task: Run code
**Task** Run the following code. Describe the output in the space below.
**Answer** Some rural counties with small populations have the highest number of voters per 10,000 population. Worcester is first, Queen Anne's is second and Talbot is third. Because these counties have small populations, this doesn't mean that these counties have lots of voters.

```{r}
md_voters_per_10k <- md_county_population %>%
  left_join(voters_by_county) %>%
  mutate(voters_per_10k = TOTAL/population*10000) %>%
  arrange(desc(voters_per_10k))

md_voters_per_10k
```

Let's take a look at the result of this table.  There are some surprising ones at the top, some of Maryland's smallest counties! Worcester, Queen Anne's, Talbot may not have that many voters, but they also don't have a lot of people.  

Okay, now let's visualize.  We're going to build a choropleth map, with the color of each county -- the fill -- set according to the number of voters per 10K on a color gradient.  

### Task: Run code
**Task** Run the following code. Describe the output in the space below.
**Answer** Maryland's most populous counties, like Montgomery and Prince George's, have fewer voters per 10,000 than one might expect, suggesting that these counties have a lot of residents who are not registered to vote. Aside from Worcester, Queen Anne's and Talbot, Frederick and Carroll counties have high numbers of voters per 10,000 people. I also notice that this color scheme makes it a little difficult to tell subtle differences between counties.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=md_voters_per_10k, aes(fill=voters_per_10k)) +
  theme_minimal()
```
This map is okay, but the color scale makes it hard to draw fine-grained differences. Let's try applying the magma color scale we learned in the last chapter.

### Task: Run code
**Task** Run the following code. Describe the output in the space below.
**Answer** This is the same data, but it's easier to pick out the counties with the largest and smallest numbers of voters per 10,000 people because of the magma color scale. This color scale doesn't make it any easier to tell the difference in voters per 10k between counties that fall in the same color category - say, Frederick and Carroll counties.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=md_voters_per_10k, aes(fill=voters_per_10k)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_viridis_b(option="magma")
```
The highest ranking counties stand out nicely in this version, but it's still hard to make out fine-grained differences between other counties.

So let's change the color scale to a "log" scale, which will help us see those differences a bit more clearly.

### Task: Run code
**Task** Run the following code. Describe the output in the space below. What regional patterns do you see?
**Answer** It's the same map. 
```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=md_voters_per_10k, aes(fill=voters_per_10k)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_viridis_b(option="magma",trans = "log")
```
Let's repeat that for Unaffiliated voters:

### Task: Run code
**Task** Run the following code. Describe the output in the space below.
**Answer** There is a new column showing the number of unaffiliated voters per 10k for each county. It's a little hard to tell this from this dataframe, but it would be interesting to watch results in counties with lots of voters as well as lots of unaffiliated voters per 10k.

```{r}
md_voters_per_10k <- md_voters_per_10k %>% 
  mutate(una_voters_per_10k = UNA/population*10000)
md_voters_per_10k
```

And then map it:

### Task: Run code
**Task** Run the following code. Describe the output in the space below. What regional patterns do you see, especially on the ends of the scale?
**Answer** This map shows that a large proportion of voters in quickly growing Frederick County are unaffiliated, suggesting this county's potential to sway election results depending how these voters vote. Anne Arundel and Howard counties might also be interested to watch for similar reasons. Somewhere like Prince George's County or Baltimore City, with lots of Democratic voters and few unaffiliated voters, is less likely to have competitive races. The same might be true of Garrett and Somerset counties, except they would likely lean strongly Republican.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=md_voters_per_10k, aes(fill=una_voters_per_10k)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_viridis_b(option="magma",trans = "log")
```
